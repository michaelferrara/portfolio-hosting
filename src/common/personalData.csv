"I’m currently a senior at the University of Central Florida. I’ve been programming since the 9th grade and have developed a passion for it ever since. I love learning new fields, and I specialize in Web and Game Development. I also have experience with machine learning and AI algorithms. I’m a hard worker and willing to learn whatever is needed for a given job or task. I hope to one day release my own collection of apps and games on the app stores and manage them, as well as make my own passion project of a large-scale action RPG videogame.
