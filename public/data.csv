The Court of the Crimson King,"The Court of the Crimson King is a 2D, rouge-like, turn based RPG created using Unity and C#. The game follows the main character as they progress through four randomly generated dungeons of varying length, complete randomized quests, gather gold and monster, and fight bosses along the way in their efforts to stop King Crimson. The game features a combat system with different effects such as poison, burn, paralysis, and more. Gather potions and items to help you progress through the game as you train your monsters. The game is thematically music based, meaning all monsters are based off different songs, albums, and artists. You even can listen to the opposing monsters’ songs as you battle your way through the dungeon.","TCCK1.png,TCCK2.png,TCCK3.png,TCCK4.png,TCCK5.png","Unity,C#,Excel","This project was a semester long project with me and two other people.
